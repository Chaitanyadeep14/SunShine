                    <h2 class="slide-in-left">Our Founder’s Journey in Die Making</h2>
                    <p class="slide-in-left">Passionate about innovation and craftsmanship, our founder’s journey has been nothing short of inspiring. From humble beginnings to pioneering new techniques in die making, his leadership has steered us to excellence.</p>
                    <p class="slide-in-left">
                        The journey of the founder is a testament to determination, vision, and 
                        perseverance. After earning a diploma in mechanical engineering, he began his 
                        career in the manufacturing industry, gaining invaluable experience. However, 
                        his entrepreneurial spirit and ambition drove him to take a bold step
                         establishing his own factory. 
                         <br><br>Starting with just a single lathe machine, he meticulously expanded the 
                            business through strategic investments in advanced machinery. Each addition 
                            was carefully chosen to enhance production capabilities and efficiency. With 
                            unwavering dedication and a commitment to excellence, a small workshop 
                            gradually evolved into a fully operational, state-of-the-art manufacturing 
                            facility.
                        <span class="more-content" id="founder-more">
                            

                            <br><br>One of the founder's major achievements came when he designed and built a 
                            revolutionary pulverizer machine. This machine was engineered to separate 
                            mild steel from land in a process similar to gold extraction, where gold is 
                            separated from sand. The pulverizer was a breakthrough in industrial 
                            technology, helping a leading company efficiently extract mild steel from the 
                            earth. This invention became a defining milestone in the company's growth and 
                            solidified its reputation for engineering innovation. 

                             <br><br>His relentless drive for excellence and passion for innovation has been the 
                            cornerstone of the company’s success, guiding it to where it is today. With a 
                            commitment to continuous improvement, the founder continues to lead the 
                            company with vision, creativity, and a deep understanding of both the industry 
                            and its evolving needs.
